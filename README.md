This repository contains the source code for the Pablo Vault and Fee Distribution Contracts.

## Behaviour

This section elaborates on the functionalities and interactions of CosmWasm contracts used for staking and fee distribution within the Cosmos network.

### 1. Distributor Contract
- **Functionality**: Receives and allocates tokens based on predefined rules.
- **Features**:
  - Supports various Cosmos denominations (denoms), accounts, and percentage-based distributions.
  - Enables the transfer of tokens to multiple contracts or addresses, ensuring versatile distribution.
  - Suitable for various applications including staking and the Osmosis adapter pool (note: no integration with the pool).

### 2. Fee Collector Contract
- **Functionality**: Serves as a recipient for tokens from the Distributor contract, acting as a secure storage.
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Receives a specific portion of tokens from the Distributor contract.
  - Implements checks and permissions to ensure secure and authorized withdrawals of tokens.
  - Allows the Staking contract to withdraw tokens.

### 3. Staking Contract
- **Functionality**: Manages the staking of tokens and facilitates the distribution of rewards.
- **Features**:
  - "Tokens per interval" parameter sets a maximum limit for distribution within a specified timeframe.
  - Distributes the lesser of total tokens in the collector or "time x tokens per interval."
  - Issues stTokens to users in representation of their stake.
  - stTokens are value-accruing, allowing holders to collect a portion of fees proportional to their stToken holdings.
- **Distribution**: 
  - Occurs at predefined intervals with immediate accrual of user shares upon staking.
  - Adopts a pro-rata distribution model, ensuring fee distribution is proportional to each userâ€™s stToken holdings.
  - Utilizes a precise user share tracking mechanism akin to other reward systems.

### Special Considerations

- **Passive Stakers**: Further investigation is necessary to ensure that passive stakers are adequately protected and fairly treated compared to those who stake at the last minute. The case of one chain accumulates and sends transfers peridocally is important.


## Environment set up

- Install [rustup][4]. Once installed, make sure you have the wasm32 target:

  ```bash
  rustup default stable
  rustup update stable
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```

- Install [Docker][6]

- Install [cargo-make][5]

  ```bash
  cargo install --force cargo-make
  ```

- Compile all contracts:

```bash
cargo make rust-optimizer
```

- Download CW20 contract:

```bash
wget -P ./artifacts/ https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/releases/download/v1.1.0/cw20_base.wasm
```

This compiles and optimizes all contracts, storing them in `/artifacts` directory along with `checksum.txt` which contains sha256 hashes of each of the `.wasm` files (The script just uses CosmWasm's [rust-optimizer][9]).

**Note:** Intel/Amd 64-bit processor is required. While there is experimental ARM support for CosmWasm/rust-optimizer, it's discouraged to use in production.

**NOTE:** on Apple devices an architecture suffix may be required.

## Deployment

See deployment [scripts](./scripts/README.md).

## Schemas

```bash
cargo make --makefile Makefile.toml generate-all-schemas
```

Creates JSON schema files for relevant contract calls, queries and query responses (See: [cosmwams-schema][10]).

## Linting

`rustfmt` is used to format any Rust source code:

```bash
cargo +nightly fmt
```

`clippy` is used as a linting tool:

```bash
cargo make clippy
```

## Testing

Integration tests (task `integration-test` or `test`) use `.wasm` files. They have to be generated with `cargo make build`.

Run unit tests:

```bash
cargo make unit-test
```

Run all tests:

```bash
cargo make test
```
